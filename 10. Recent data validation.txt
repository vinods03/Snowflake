After the Pipeline has run and the recent changes are available in the "recent" folder of the S3 bucket, run the below query in Snowflake to verify the count: 
select count(*) from ecommerce_database.public.orders;

Also, in the AWS Glue Crawler, add the data source s3://vinod-ecommerce-data-from-rds/orders/recent on top of the existing s3://vinod-ecommerce-data-from-rds/orders/historical and run the crawler. Another Glue Catalog table "orders_recent" will be created in addition to the already created "orders_historical" table. Rename the columns in the "orders_recent" table also similar to the orders_historical table. Run the below queries in Athena:

select count(*) from orders_recent;
select count(*) from order_historical;

The sum of these 2 must match the count in Snowflake.

Also, you can validate the counts with the source RDS MySQL table.
