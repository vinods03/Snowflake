To verify easily if the data from RDS has been moved to S3 as expected, we can quickly setup the Glue Crawler and run some queries using athena.

Setup a On demand Glue Crawler (ecommerce-orders-historical) with Data Source as S3 -> s3://vinod-ecommerce-data-from-rds/orders/historical and Table Prefix as orders_
The Glue Data Catalog table is configured to be created in a new Glue Catalog database ecommerce-database.
Rename the columns in the Glue Data Catalog table - referring the join between orders and customers tables in the AWS Data Pipeline setup will be helpful to rename the columns.

Also note that the Data Pipeline stores the files under a timestamp folder as indicated in the DataNodes -> S3OutputLocation path of the pipeline.
#{myOutputS3Loc}/#{format(@scheduledStartTime, 'YYYY-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss')}.
This column can be named as the create_timestamp column -> this is not part of the RDS data.

Once the Glue Crawler completes, verify in Athena using the query:
SELECT * FROM "AwsDataCatalog"."ecommerce-database"."orders_historical" limit 10;
